# Project1-Connect-Four
# Overview
For project 1, I created a two-player connect four game. The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. Moves entails in placing new pieces on the board; pieces slide downwards from upper holes, falling down to the last row or piling up on the last piece introduced in the same column.
